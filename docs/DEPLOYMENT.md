# Deployment

Beacon is deployed as one GenLayer Intelligent Contract and a static browser frontend.

## Contract

1. Install the pinned tooling with `python3 -m venv .venv` and `.venv/bin/python -m pip install -r contract/requirements.txt`.
2. Run `npm run check` from the repository root.
3. Deploy `contract/contracts/beacon.py` using the repository-local GenLayer CLI against Studionet.
4. Record the deployed address only after its deployment transaction has reached finality and its source matches the reviewed Git blob.

## Frontend

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` inside `frontend/`.
2. Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_BEACON_CONTRACT_ADDRESS` to the finalized contract address.
3. Run `npm --prefix frontend run build`.

The browser talks directly to the GenLayer RPC and the user’s EIP-1193 wallet. It contains no server wallet, API route, database, or background worker.
